Data Dictionary:
````````````````
	- T-Code SE11
	- It also called as ABAP Dictionary or DDIC


Domain:
```````
	- It is a predefined set of values, which can be uesd to define the data type and length of field


Conversion Routine:
```````````````````
	- Used to convert data from external format to internal format and vice versa


Data Element:
`````````````
	- It is a domain based individual and reusable object.
	- It defines properties and attributes of particular data field
	- It provides a description of data field, including field name, label, data type, lenght etc.,
	- It can be also include documentation and search help


Delivery Class:
```````````````
	- It defines which type of table we are creating in SAP
	- Used for controlling data transport of table during installation, upgrade and transporting between customer systems.
	- It is a property assigned to an object in the data dictionary which indicates how the object is transported between different systems


Data class:
```````````
	- It defines which type of data we are going to store in table.
	- Tell us in which portion of database the table data will get stored.
	- It keeps all Master Data together, all Transaction Data together, all User Data together and all Organizational Data together.


Size category:
``````````````
	- To tell us how many no of records can be stored onto that table


Structure:
``````````
	- Collection of fields/columns of similar/different data types
	- Structure does not have any physical data
	- Two types of Structure
		> Include Structure
			- It is reusable
			- Can insert at any point of table
			- Applicable only for Custom table

		> Append Structure
			- It is not reusable
			- Can insert only at end of the table
			- Applicable to both Standard table and Custom table


Table:
``````
	- SE11 / SE16 / SE16N
	- Tables can store data
	- Table with MAND Fields are client dependent or client specific
	- Table without MAND Fields are client independent table.


Primary Key:
````````````
	- A primary key is a column, or set of columns, that uniquely identifies each row.
	- Each table in a relational database should have a primary key.
	- A primary key column cannot accept null values.
	- Primary columns have a maximum length of 900 bytes.
	- No two rows in a table can have the same primary key value, and no column in a primary key can contain the NULL value.


Foreign Key:
````````````
	- A foreign key links data in one table to data in another table, usually by pointing to the primary key column in the other table
	- A foreign key allows you to assign data records in the foreign key table and check table. 
	- By using the entries in the foreign key fields, one record of the foreign key table uniquely identifies one record of the check table.


Indexes:
````````
	- An index is a sorted copy of database table field which is help to speed up the selection of data.


Types of Indexes:
`````````````````
	- Primary Index:
		> Primary index is created automatically by the SAP system using Primary key fields of the table.
		> This copies the data in sorted form

	- Secondary Index:
		> Secondary index is created manually and managed by SAP ABAP Consultant using non primary key field.
		> Maximum 6 secondary index we can create for a particular database table.
		> Secondary index used Binary Search for that reason searching also faster as compare to primary index.


Types of SAP Data:
``````````````````
	- Master data : Accessed very frequently, but rarely changed
	- Transaction data : Frequently changed, no of records gets increasing continuously
	- Configuration data : Customize depends on business / customer requirement


Search Help:
````````````
	- Purpose is to display the various possible value for any input field
	- Also known as F4 Help (Value Help)
	- Selection Method : It is based on the table or view from where to fetch the data
	- Dialog Type : Display values immediately, dialog with values restriction, dislog depends upon set of values
	- Search Help paramater : Fields used to search
	- LPOS (List of Position) : When values got displayed
	- SPOS (Screen Position) : Before displaying the values
	- SDIS (Selection Display) : To make field read only mode
	- Modify : Can define new data element without changing table field direclty
	- Two Types of Search Help
		> Elementary search help - Single search help
		> Collective search help - Combination of elementary search help


Cardinality:
````````````
	- The number of rows that match can be none (0), one (1), or many (n) for each table
	- No of records in key table, corresponds to how many no of records in forrign table


Table Pool:
``````````` 
	- The SAP database stores all the Pooled tables into a single table, which is known as a table pool.


Table cluster:
```````````````
	- All the cluster tables are stored in a single table in the database, and that table is known as a table cluster.


Check Table:
````````````
	- The check table is the table used by system to check whether the data exist or not in foreign key table field.
	- Whenever you are trying to create the table, if you are sure the field contains some values that values only you can use in another foreign key Data Base Table.


Value Table:
````````````
	- Value Table is a table that contains all the valid entries of a domain and this domain can be reused in multiple tables.
	- This is maintained at domain level.


Types of Database Table:
````````````````````````
	- Transparent table:
		> 1:1 relationship between ABAP dictionary and Database
		> One table in ABAP dictionary corresponds to One table in Database
		> Usually used to store Master data

	- Pooled Table:
		> Special table types used to store data from several different tables.
		> Primary Foreign key relationship is not required
		> They are defined by being saved in table pools rather than being defined as pooled tables on database
		> N:1 relationship between  ABAP dictionary and Database
		> Many tables in ABAP dictionary corresponds to One table in Database
		> Structure of Pooled tables - TABNAME, VARKEY, DATALN, VARDATA
		> Pool table is basically use to store Application Data.

	- Cluster Table: (BSEG)
		> Special table types used to store data from several different tables.
		> Primary Foreign key relationship is mandatory
		> They are defined by being saved in table clusters rather than being defined as cluster tables on database
		> N:1 relationship between  ABAP dictionary and Database
		> Many tables in ABAP dictionary corresponds to One table in Database
		> Structure of Cluster table - KEY, PAGENO, VARDATA
		> Cluster table is basically use to store Application Data.

Views:
``````
	- It is a Virtual table that provides a specific view of the data stored in one or more table.
	- It does not have stores data records.


Database View:
``````````````
	- Created on top of single or multiple tables
	- Tables should have relationship between them
	- Supports both projection and selection
	- Projection refers to process of Selecting only required fields
	- Selection refers to process of imposing conditions on accessing the table
	- This view can be used in SELECT queries
	- Not possible to generate Table Maintenance
	- View Created on single table can either be read only or read and change
	- View Created on multiple table is always read only


Projection View:
````````````````
	- Created on top of single table only.
	- Selecting only the required fields from on speicific table
	- Supports only projection and does not support selection
	- This view can be used in SELECT queries
	- Not possible to generate Table Maintenance
	- Maintenance Status can either be read only or read and change


Maintenance View:
`````````````````
	- Created on top of single or multiple tables
	- It accepts more than two Tables but should be linked using Foreign Key relationship. 
	- Purpose of this view is to provide a simplified interface for updating the database tables
	- Join conditions are proposed by SAP based on selected tables Foreign key relationship.
	- Supports both projection and selection
	- This view cannot be used in SELECT queries
	- Can able to generate Table Maintenance
	- Tables should have relationship between them
	- Maintenance Status can either be read only or read and change or read, change, delete, insert
	- Cardinality should be 1:1


Help View:
``````````
	- Created on top of single or multiple tables
	- Purpose of this view is to provide additional information in search options
	- Tables should have relationship between them
	- Supports both projection and selection
	- This view cannot be used in SELECT queries
	- Not possible to generate Table Maintenance
	- It is based on left outer join condition
	- Maintenance Status is read only
	- Cardinality should be 1:1


Buffering:
``````````
	- Sometimes we need to access a particular set of records more frequently then others
	- So rather than fetching the data from database layer everytime we can use buffering
	- It fetches the data from database layer and stores in a temporary storage in application layer 
	- It improves performance
	- We can see buffered data in AL12 > Monitor > Buffers > Table Buffer > Buffer content > Tabel name
	- Transaction code to reset all table buffer from application layer - /$TAB


Types of Buffering:
```````````````````
	- Singe Record buffered
		> Single records get loaded on application layer

	- Generic Area Buffered
		> Records matches the generic key are loaded in the application	layer buffering
		> when to use? we will used for Language dependent tables

	- Fully Buffered
		> Full table records will load in the application layer buffered
		> Best suitable for frequently accessed and rarely changed


Lock Object:
````````````
	- It is used to synchronize access to the same data by more than one program. 
	- Data records are accessed with the help of specific programs. 
	- Lock objects are used in SAP to avoid the inconsistency when data is inserted into or changed in the database. 
	- Tables whose data records are to be locked must be defined in a Lock Object, along with their key fields.


Types of Lock Objects:
``````````````````````
	> Exclusive 
	> Shared  
	> Exclusive not cumulative 
	> Optimistic Lock
